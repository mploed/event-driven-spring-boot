# Event Driven Applications with Spring Boot

This projects tries to capture various options you have when dealing with Event Driven Spring Boot applications.
The follwing Spring Technologies are being used:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud Stream Rabbit
- Spring Data JPA

These examples contain various different ways to model and deal with events:
- Complete aggregates / entities in the events
- REST Resource URLs in events
- Partial parsing / handling of events in consumers
- Events as Atom Feeds

## Prerequisites
- You need to have Docker installed

## How to run and install the example
In the root directory you need to
1. Compile everything with ./mvnw package
2. Start everything up with docker-compose up --build

## Running on Kubernetes
Mind the KubernetesSetup.md file in the kubernetes directory

## URLs and Ports
Each of the modules is it's own Spring Boot Application which can be accessed as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Application / Enpoint Type</th>
        <th>URL</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Application Process</td>
        <td>9000</td>
        <td>http://localhost:9000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Credit Application</td>
        <td>9001</td>
        <td>http://localhost:9001/credit-application</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Customer</td>
        <td>9002</td>
        <td>http://localhost:9002/customer and http://localhost:9002/customer/feed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Scoring</td>
        <td>9003</td>
        <td>No UI</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>CreditDecision</td>
        <td>9004</td>
        <td>http://localhost:9004/credit-decision and http://localhost:9004/credit-decision/feed</td>
    </tr>
      
    
</table>

## Messaging Infrastructure & Domain Events

### Public Events

#### CreditApplicationNumberGeneratedEvent
Source: application-process

Persisted in source: no

Consumers:
- credit-application
- credit-decision

Topic: CreditApplicationNumberGeneratedTopic


#### CreditApplicationEnteredEvent
Source: credit-application

Persisted in source: yes in its own Table via JPA

Consumers:
- application-process
- credit-decision

Topic: CreditApplicationEnteredTopic


#### CustomerCreatedEvent
Source: customer

Persisted in source: no

Consumers:
- application-process
- credit-decision

Topic: CustomerCreatedTopic

#### ScoringPositiveEvent
Source: scoring

Persisted in source: no

Consumers:
- application-process
- credit-decision

Topic: ScoringPositiveTopic

#### ScoringNegativeEvent
Source: scoring

Persisted in source: no

Consumers:
- application-process
- credit-decision

Topic: ScoringNegativeTopic

#### ApplicationDeclinedEvent
Source: credit-decision

Persisted in source: not as an event

Consumers:
- application-process

Topic: ApplicationDeclinedTopic

### Internal Events

#### Credit-Application
- CreditDetailsEnteredEvent
- FinancialSituationEnteredEvent

Both events are stored
Source: credit-application
Storage: Own Table via JPA


### Feeds

#### Customer Feed
Url: http://localhost:9002/customer/feed

Contains URLs to Customer Resources

#### Credit Decision Feed
Url: http://localhost:9004/credit-decision/feed

Contains Application Numbers that have been confirmed


## Event Types being used
This demo shows various types of event types: Events with all the data, Events with Resource Urls and "Events" as Feeds

#### Events with all the data
Especially the CreditApplicationEnteredEvent falls into this category: it contains all of the data for the credit application
such as the financial situation and the details of the actual credit. By consuming this event you will not need additional
roundtrips to upstream systems

Other events that fall into this category are:
- ApplicationNumberGeneratedEvent
- ScoringNegativeEvent
- ScoringPositiveEvent
- ApplicationDeclinedEvent

##### Idea of Bounded Context:
Please take a close look at how the CreditApplicationEnteredEvent is being reflected in the scoring application. Yes, we
take in all the payload from the broker but the public model of the event has a clear focus on the scoring context's view
on the data.

#### Events with a Resource URL
These Events do not contain a lot of information. They may contain something like a business process identifier such as
the applicationNumber in this example but for the purpose of this demo I refrained from doing that. So the CustomerCreatedEvent
only contians the URL to the Customer REST Resource from which interested contexts can obtain the payload from.


#### "Events" via Feeds
Although the usage of feeds is no plain and pure event driven processing style I think that they come in handy when you
are dealing with situations like these:
- you have issues with your message broker and firewalls and these issues can't be resolved easily
- you need to have an event replay functionality in place that enables consumers to restore their replicated data

You can find "Events via Feeds" in the customer and the credit-decision (see Feeds) applications.
